This work deals with 3D depth reconstruction of a scene using 2D images captured from different angles (light field imaging). From the structure of the epipolar plane images (EPIs) the depth is calculated using the structure tensor. In this thesis, various modifications of existing algorithms are tested, further depth-of-defocus techniques will be tested and compared. In addition, an algorithm based on the semi-global matching algorithm (SGM), commonly used in stereo vision, is implemented as a post-processing step.
