This work deas with 3D depth reconstruction of a scene using 2D images captured from different angles (light field imaging). From the structure of the Epipolar Plane Images (EPIs) the depth is calculated using the structure tensor In this thesis various modifications of existing algorithms will be developed and tested, further depth-of-defocus techniques will be tested and compared. In addition, an algorithm based on the SemiGlobal Matching Algorithm (SGM) ,commonly used in Stereo vision, is implemented as a postprocessing step.
